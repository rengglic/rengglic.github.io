To kick off the holiday seasons I wanted to write down my thoughts on the current stage of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and especially the _retrieval_ part of it.
This post is not necessarely the truth, but merely my somewhat biased view on the topic based on my experience, interrests, and deeper believes aligned with my intrisinc motivation to understand a
field that is currenlty dominated by empirical progress and little fundamental understanding.
